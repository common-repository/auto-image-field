This plugin allow you to administrate image custom fields easily using the wordpress media gallery
== Description ==

This plugin allows you to create custom fields to manage image custom fields easily from the administration screen.

This plugin is based on the fantastic plugin [NKMImageField from Naomi Millman](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/nkmimagefield/). 
Anyway neither this or any other did what I was lookingfor: Let me attach images from the media library in custom fields easily.

So I created this plugin to allow me to do that and a little more:

    * Allows create, edit or delete custom fields from the administration 
      of the following values wordpress:
          o Field Name.
          o Field description.
          o Default value of this field.
    * On screen editing of messages can add the images from the multimedia library.

The plugin will try not to leave the field empty,if the field isn't filled will try to find the first image post. However in  case that none image is found will take the default value.

== Installation ==

1. Use the wordpress plugin manager to upload the plugin.

3. There is a new option in Options Menu. Auto Image Field. There you may create new fields for the post.
4. In the new post menu you should have new boxes with the new fields. Just fill them up with url or choose one from the media library. 
4. Done!.
